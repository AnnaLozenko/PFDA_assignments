# Assignents for Programming for Data Analytics

This repository contains assignments for the "Programming for Data Analytics" course. Each assignment is organized in its own directory, with relevant code, data, and information included.

## Directory Structure
- [Assignment 02 Bankholidays](https://github.com/AnnaLozenko/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment02-bankholidays.py): contains the first assignment which focuses on identifying bank holidays in Northern Ireland by writing a Python program that prints the full list of dates for all Northern Irish bank holidays. The task is then extended to determine which of these holidays are unique to Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the UK.
- [Assignment 03 Pie](https://github.com/AnnaLozenko/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment03-pie.ipynb): contains the second assignment which involves creating a pie chart that visualises the distribution of email domains among individuals listed in a dataset. The data can be accessed directly from the provided URL or downloaded locally. The task requires producing a clear and well-presented pie chart that effectively illustrates the relative frequencies of the different email domains.
- [Assignment 05 Population](https://github.com/AnnaLozenko/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment05-population.ipynb): contains the third assignment which examines sex-based demographic differences in Ireland using Census 2022 data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The analysis is carried out in a single Jupyter Notebook and structured in three stages. First, it calculates the weighted mean age for males and females and evaluates national-level population differences across all ages. Second, it defines a target age and groups individuals within a five-year range to quantify the sex-based population difference for that age band. Finally, it identifies the Irish region with the largest population difference within the same age group.
- [Assignment 06 Weather](https://github.com/AnnaLozenko/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment_6_Weather.ipynb): contains the fourth assignment which involves analysing weather data from Knock Airport using hourly observations obtained from the provided dataset. The dataset contains different type of weather observations from year 1996 to 2025. The task includes visualising the temperature series, calculating and plotting the mean temperature for each day, and producing a monthly mean temperature overview. It also requires examining windspeed patterns by plotting the raw windspeed data, computing a rolling 24-hour windspeed measure, identifying the daily maximum windspeed, and determining the monthly mean of these daily maxima.
